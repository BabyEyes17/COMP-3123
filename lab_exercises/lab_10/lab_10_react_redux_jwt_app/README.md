# COMP 3123 - Lab 10 - React Redux & JWT

In short, my application resembles the lab that focused on Context API last Friday (24/11/2025).

## How It Works

###Login

- Clicking Login generates a fake JWT token

- A demo user object is created

- Both are saved to the Redux store using the login() action

- App navigates to the Dashboard

### Dashboard

- Displays the stored JWT

- Shows the logged-in user info

- Used to demonstrate Redux state changes for the lab
